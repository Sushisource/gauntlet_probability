This is a fun little excuse to write some elm - it illustrates why it can be a good idea to
implement processes in large organizations which, although potentially slowing down individuals, may serve to speed progress
across the organization as a whole.

Building
--------
`elm make src/Main.elm --output main.html`

Viewing
--------
Open main.html, foo.
